                <h1>Esther Oluwadamilola Agboola</h1>
                <p>
                  Esther Oluwadamilola Agboola is a passionate lover of God,
                  with an earnest desire to see teenagers thrive against all
                  odds, not just in their academics but also in their spiritual
                  life and morals. She received the vision for teenage ministry
                  in 2021, and decided to engage few teenagers from church in
                  one-on-one conversations, checking on them during the week via
                  telephone calls, praying with them occasionally, alongside
                  other hospitality treats. In 2022, she received the vision
                  concerning those that will embark on the journey towards the
                  teenage ministry, and together in 2023, ‘The Balanced
                  Teenagers’ group was founded.</p> <p>Esther graduated from secondary
                  school in 2013 as the overall best graduating student (Gladys
                  High School) and proceeded to complete her first degree in
                  Accounting at Joseph Ayo Babalola University, where she bagged
                  a First-Class Honors. On her convocation day, she was the sole
                  recipient of a scholarship from University College of Social
                  Science (UCSS), Poland, to complete her Master’s degree. For
                  reasons best known to her, she forfeited the scholarship and
                  proceeded to complete her professional qualification. In 2018,
                  she completed her professional examination and became inducted
                  in 2019 as an associate member of the Institute of Chartered
                  Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN). That same year (2019), she
                  attended a French school for approximately 6 months, in a bid
                  to embrace diversity of language. Also, in same year, she was
                  opportune to receive another scholarship to complete her
                  Masters in the United Kingdom, and this time around, she
                  embraced the scholarship and proceeded to complete her second
                  degree in Accounting and Finance at University of Nottingham,
                  United Kingdom, United Kingdom where she graduated with
                  Distinction in 2020.</p> <p>Upon arrival in the UK in 2019, she
                  applied for CPA Australia Strategic Management Accounting
                  Scholarship. And out of all the universities in UK, the
                  scholarship was awarded to just 2 students; she was one out of
                  the two awardees. She is currently on the final stage of
                  completing a professional qualification to become an associate
                  member of Association of Certified Chartered Accountants
                  (ACCA), and Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Australia.
                  Esther is a professional baker and has recently commenced her
                  Doctorate Degree.</p>
